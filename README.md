## Compare Same App With Redux or JSX or Angular or Polymer

### Same App In React Redux

You can compare this app to the same app with Redux.

This is a good way to see how to convert an existing React app to React Redux.

- [react-redux-example](https://github.com/reactjsexample/react-redux-example)

### Same App In React JSX

You can compare this app to the same app with React JSX.

This is a good way to see how to convert an existing React app to React TypeScript.

- [react-example-app](https://github.com/reactjsexample/react-example-app)

### Same App In Angular Or Polymer

Here is the same app written in Angular and Polymer:

- [angular-9-example-app](https://github.com/angularexample/angular-9-example-app)
- [polymer-3-example-app](https://github.com/polymerexample/polymer-3-example-app)

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node and NPM installed on your PC.

[Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### How To Install

Download the source code using git or else download and unzip the zip file.

Open a terminal window and go to the project root folder.

You need to have npm installed globally.

Run `npm i` to install the required libraries.

### How To Run

Open a terminal window and make sure you are in the project root folder.

Run the following command for a dev server.

#### `npm  start`

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The browser will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Open the browser's Developer Tools window to see any errors in the Console.

### How To Run Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, you need to stop the server.
 
If the server is running, stop the server from the terminal window by pressing *Control-C*.

To run the unit tests, Run the following command in the terminal window.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### How To Build For Production

Run the following command to do a production build.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the *build* folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
